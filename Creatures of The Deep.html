                <h2>Bigfin Squid</h2>
                <p>The bigfin squid is a deep sea creture that has horrifyingly long legs. Not much is known about them however, it is believed that it uses those long legs to hunt for food on the sea floor</p>

                <h2>Telescope Fish</h2>
                <p>Telescope fish are fish that got their name from their eyes. They are fairly small and aren't a threat to us but their lookas still make people never want to swim</p>

                <h2>Goblin Sharks</h2>
                <p>This freak of nature is a goblin shark. They are predators in the deeper sea that have a long snout and teeth. Although there are no recorded fatalities, these things could still eat you making them more dangerous than the previous two monstrosities.</p>

                <h2>Frilled Shark</h2>
                <p>This here is a frilled shark. Yes you heard me. This freaky looking fossilized eel creature is a shark. They are a change of pace from the goblin sharks as the frilled shark is harmless to humans. Fun fact, They are pregnant for 3.5 years, longer than any vertebrate.</p>

                <h2>Siphonophore</h2>
                <p>This Lovecraftian flying spaghetti monster is a Siphonophore. It is actually many organisms combined, meaning if you cut it, it would live on. This means that it could grow to be the longest living organism. Imagine seeing something like this bigger than a blue whale. And the icing on the cake is that SOME OF THEM ARE VENOMOUS.</p>

                <h2>Gulper Eel</h2>
                <p>It has a big mouth. Will eat food bigger than it. Can give small shocks to humans. Would not like to elaborate.</p>

                <h2>Dumbo Octopus</h2>
                <p>Lets move on to something cuter. The Dumbo octopus, named after Dumbo the Elephant due to the fins on it's head, is one of the deepest livng octopuses and one of the most adorable too. </p>

                <h2>Pygmy Seahorse</h2>
                <p>Finishing off strong we have the Pygmy Seahorse. They have pink bumps all over their body to disguise them in the coral from predators. They are less than 2cm tall and will make you explode just seeing them. Here are a few more pictures. </p>
